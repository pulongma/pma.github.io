About Me
======
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2em;"> 
I have been a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI) and Duke University under the guidance of Dr. James O. Berger at Duke University since 2018, where I was also participating in the 2018-2019 research program on <a href="https://www.samsi.info/model-uncertainty-mathematical-statistical-mums/" target="blank" style="color:blue;">Model Uncertainty: Mathematical and Statistical</a> (MUMS). Before that, I got my Ph.D. in Statistics in 2018 at University of Cincinnati under the guidance of Dr. Emily L. Kang and Dr. Bledar A. Konomi with dissertation topic in spatial and spatio-temporal statistics. I will join the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/science/departments/math-stat/index.html" target="blank" style="color:blue;">School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.clemson.edu" target="blank" syle="color:blue;">Clemson University</a> as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2021.</p>


My statistical research is stimulated by real-world challenges and aims at addressing real-world problems in physical sciences including remote sensing science and climate science, engineering science, and medical science. My main statistical research is focused on the deveopment of flexible statistical methods to understand physical and environmental processes. It spans the following areas of statistics and machine learning:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)</b>: Computer model validation, computer model emulation, extrapolation, Bayesian calibration, Bayesian inverse problem, UQ for deep learning models, design and analysis of stochastic simulators</li>
  
  <li><b>Bayesian Statistics</b>: Bayesian nonparametrics, objective Bayes, Bayesian hierarchical modeling and computation, Bayesian variable selection, Bayesian deep learning, model uncertainty </li>
  
  <li> <b>Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Statistics</b>: Random fields, nonstationary space-time processes, dynamic spatio-temporal models, multivariate spatial and spatio-temporal models, data fusion </li>
</ul>

<!-- In July 2018, I got my Ph.D. in Statistics from University of Cincinnati under the guidance of Dr. Emily L. Kang and Dr. Bledar A. Konomi. During my Ph.D., I have worked on spatial and spatio-temporal statistics with applications in remote sensing science, climate science, and environmental science. In particular, I developed flexible (e.g., nonstationary and nonseparable) spatial and spatio-temporal process models for massive datasets. I also proposed a statistical downscaling framework to simulate high-resolution geophysical processes with applications in global observing system simulation experiments.    -->
