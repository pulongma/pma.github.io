About Me
======
I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI) and Duke University, where I am participating in the program on <a href="https://www.samsi.info/programs-and-activities/year-long-research-programs/model-uncertainty-mathematical-statistical-mums/" target="blank">Model Uncertainty: Mathematical and Statistical</a> (MUMS). I am working on the following areas: 
<ul>
  <li> Uncertainty Quantification (UQ): extrapolation, Gaussian process emulator with physical constraints</li>
  <li> Bayesian methods: Bayesian hierarchical modeling and computation, Bayesian variable selection, scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo methods </li>
  <li> Computer experiments: Bayesian calibration, computer model emulation </li>
  <li> Spatial and spatio-temporal statistics: nonstationary space-time processes, dynamic spatio-temporal models, multivariate models, downscaling, data fusion. </li>
</ul>

In July 2018, I got my Ph.D. in Statistics from University of Cincinnati under the guidance of Dr. Emily L. Kang and Dr. Bledar A. Konomi. During my Ph.D., I have worked on spatial and spatio-temporal statistics with applications in remote-sensing science, climate science, and environmental science. In particular, I developed flexible (e.g., nonstationary and nonseparable) spatial and spatio-temporal process models for massive datasets. I also proposed a statistical downscaling framework to simulate high-resolution geophysical processes with applications in global observing system simulation experiments.
