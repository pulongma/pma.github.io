About Me
======
I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI) and Duke University, where I was participating in the program on <a href="https://www.samsi.info/programs-and-activities/year-long-research-programs/model-uncertainty-mathematical-statistical-mums/" target="blank">Model Uncertainty: Mathematical and Statistical</a> (MUMS) in 2018-2019 under the guidance of Dr. James O. Berger at Duke University. Before that, I got my Ph.D. in Statistics in 2018 at University of Cincinnati under the guidance of Dr. Emily L. Kang and Dr. Bledar A. Konomi with dissertation topic in spatial and spatio-temporal statistics. My current research areas include: 
<ul>
  <li> <b>Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)</b>: Extrapolation, Gaussian process emulator with physical constraints, Experimental design, computer model emulation, discrepancy, Bayesian calibration, design and analysis of stochastic simulators, Bayesian inverse problem, UQ for deep learning models</li>
  <li><b>Bayesian Statistics</b>: Bayesian decision theory, objective Bayes, Bayesian hierarchical modeling and computation, Bayesian variable selection, scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, Bayesian deep learning, model uncertainty </li>
  <li> <b>Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Statistics</b>: Random fields, nonstationary space-time processes, dynamic spatio-temporal models, multivariate models, downscaling, data fusion, spatial extremes. </li>
</ul>

<!-- In July 2018, I got my Ph.D. in Statistics from University of Cincinnati under the guidance of Dr. Emily L. Kang and Dr. Bledar A. Konomi. During my Ph.D., I have worked on spatial and spatio-temporal statistics with applications in remote sensing science, climate science, and environmental science. In particular, I developed flexible (e.g., nonstationary and nonseparable) spatial and spatio-temporal process models for massive datasets. I also proposed a statistical downscaling framework to simulate high-resolution geophysical processes with applications in global observing system simulation experiments.    -->
